\acknowledgments

I would like to thank Sunil Vichare, Technical Officer and Ninad N. Shaha, Technical Superintendent of Computer Center, IIT Bombay for there constant support with hardware and internet bandwidth.  As, these datasets are in a few hundred GBs, so to download datasets large disk and bandwidth are required. CSE-Sysad, IIT Bombay has also helped us with the hardware support. More important, I would like thank VIGIL lab, IIT Bombay for providing voxel servers with GPUs. Without any GPU machine, completing this dissertation was near to impossible
